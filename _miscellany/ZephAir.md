**Built for HackUConn 2017**

ZephAir was created as part of a 24 hour hackathon themed around allergies, allergy prevention, and allergy treatment. ZephAir placed third overall based on overall quality of the solution, creativity and innovation around the idea or prototype, quality of the product's design, and presentation to the judges.
