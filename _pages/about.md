*Under construction*

I'm a PhD student in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://web.mit.edu/). I currently work in the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) in the [Computation and Biology](http://people.csail.mit.edu/bab/) group, where my research broadly focuses on addressing challenges in biology and human health with computational methods.

Previously, I was a member of the [Computational Biology Research Lab](https://compbio.engr.uconn.edu/) at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/), where my research focused on [phylogenetic methods for understanding infectious disease](https://compbio.engr.uconn.edu/software/treefix-tp/).
