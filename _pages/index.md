I'm currently a Flatiron Research Fellow at the [Flatiron Institute][11] [Center for Computational Biology][12], where I'm a bridge fellow between the [Structural and Molecular Biophysics][13] and [Genomics][14] groups. I'm currently interested in integrating protein structures and dynamics with context-specific biological networks to understand the molecular basis of cellular processes.

I completed my PhD in the [Computation and Biology][8] group at [MIT][5] [CSAIL][7], focusing on protein language models for [protein interaction networks][9] and [drug discovery][10].

I did my undergraduate degree in the [Computational Biology Research Lab][2] at the [University of Connecticut][1], where I worked on [phylogenetics][3] and [viral transmission][4].
