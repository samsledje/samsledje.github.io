I'm a PhD student in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/">Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a> at the
<a target="_blank" href="http://web.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>. I currently work in the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/bab/">Computation and Biology</a> group at the
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab</a>.
My current research uses large protein language models (PLMs) for various protein structure related tasks, including
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/samsledje/D-SCRIPT">predicting protein interactions from amino acid sequence</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/samsledje/ConPLex">drug-target interaction prediction</a>.

Previously, I was a member of the <a target="_blank" href="https://compbio.engr.uconn.edu/">Computational Biology Research Lab</a> at the
<a target="_blank" href="https://uconn.edu/">University of Connecticut</a>, 
where my research focused on <a target="_blank" href="https://compbio.engr.uconn.edu/software/treefix-tp/">phylogenetic methods for understanding infectious disease.</a>
I also worked on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/suz11001/virDTL">mapping horizontal gene transfer in SARS-CoV-2.</a>
