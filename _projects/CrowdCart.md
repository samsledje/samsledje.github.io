**Built at HampHack 2017**

This app plans the optimal stores to visit to purchase all the items in your shopping list and displays them in order with what items to get at that store.

The app namely uses crowdsourcing to update its database values. Users simply take a clear photo of their receipt to have the OCR determine the items purchased, their prices, the date, and the location. The values from the receipts are parsed and uploaded to update our database, which then can be queried based on the user's shopping list to suggest an optimal configuration of stores to minimize money spent and distance driven.
