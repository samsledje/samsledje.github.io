EHRport - the Electronic Health Records Portal - puts patients in control of their own medical records. EHRport creates a single repository for each patient to hold their health records, and doctors are authenticated to view and add to this repository. The result is an EHR system that provides easy and secure access to electronic health records, without the need for long entry forms, faxing between practices, or CDs with images on them. EHRport is a simple way to view and transfer EHRs in a patient controlled way.
